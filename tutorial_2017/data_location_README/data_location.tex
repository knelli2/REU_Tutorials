\title{Illinois Relativity Group Data Location}
\maketitle

This document specifies the location of the selected simulation data produced by the Illinois Relativity Group. Most of our data are in HDF5 format -- this includes magnetic field (Bx.file\_*.h5, By.file\_*.h5, and Bz.file\_*.h5), matter density (rho\_b.file\_*.h5), velocity (vx.file\_*.h5, vy.file\_*.h5, and vz.file\_*.h5), pressure (P.file\_*.h5), and magnetic field magnitude $B^2/4\pi$ (smallb2.file\_*.h5). All of the HDF5 files are stored in folders with the name in pattern of 3d\_data\_XXXXXX, where "XXXXXX" indicates the date data was generated. Black hole horizon data and gravitational wave data are not in HDF5 format. Black hole data are in .gp files. Particle data are in bhns-particles.mon files. Gravitational wave data are in Psi4\_rad.mon.* files, which will require Zack's code to extract $h_+$ and $h_\times$ data. Zack's code can be found at \\ \verb|Nearline: /projects/sciteam/bakp/Zack_code.tar.gz|. \\
You will need the extraction radii for each Psi4 files, which can be found in the parameter files (*.par).


% Please note that in some case that the parameter K is not equal to 1, i.e. LORENE's data, you will need to modify Psi4 data to correct h\_plus and h\_cross values.

\section{Working with time}

In our simulations, we will refer to the time in code units (t) and iteration number (it). The time step between each frame in the visualization will be limited by the output frequency of the HDF5 files, which can be checked by reading any HDF5 file with the command "\verb|h5ls <filename>|". The HDF5 output frequency is usually every it=256. The output frequency of black hole's horizon data (.gp files) is different and will be more frequent than HDF5 files. The time for each horizon data can be easily determined from the filename. For example, the file \verb|h.t135200.ah2.gp| is the horizon data for 2nd black hole at it=135200. The time used in the particle data will be in code units. The content of the bhns-particles.mon file is listed in four tab-separated columns: t, x, y, and z position of the particles. The relationship between code unit time and iteration number is found using the first and second columns in \verb|BH_diagnostics.ah1.gp|. Alternatively, we can find the relation between t and it by loading a HDF5 file into VisIt and checking the time in the file information window.

In our visualization, we represent the time in t/M. The relation between t/M and code unit time (t) is \[ t/M = t/M_{ADM} , \] where $M_{ADM}$ is the ADM mass of the system. The value of $M_{ADM}$ for each simulation will be listed in the following sections.

\subsection{Starting Time}

In this simulation, after each regridding the time will be reset and start at zero again. To get the cumulative time from the beginning, we need to add the time in current regridding level with the starting time of the current level. The starting times are provided below. The time increment dt (in code units) between each output is also different between two levels.
\\
\\
\subsubsection{Zero B-field Case}
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
Level		& dt (over 256 it)	& Starting time (code units) \\
0		& 1600			& 0 		\\
1		& 800			& 76393.548	\\ %16709
2		& 400			& 99120.960	\\ %21680
3		& 200			& 116590.572	\\ %25501
4		& 50			& 126173.484	\\ %27597
5		& 6.25			& 130393.440	\\ %28520
After BH 	& 6.25			& 130832.352	\\ %28616
\end{tabular}
\\
\subsubsection{Interior-Only B-field Case}
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
Level		& dt (over 256 it)	& Starting time (code units) \\
0		& 1600			& 0		\\
1		& 800			& 106897.265	\\
2		& 400			& 116995.898	\\
3 		& 200			& 127733.398	\\
4		& 50			& 136889.648 	\\
After BH	& 6.25			& 137627.148 *	\\
\end{tabular}
\\
\\
** After it=133632 in this level, we halved HDF5 output frequency to output every 512 iterations. Therefore, the time increment between each frame is doubled, i.e. dt (over 512 it) = 12.5. 
\\
\subsubsection{Interior and Exterior B-field Case}
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
Level		& dt (over 256 it)	& Starting time (code units) \\
0		& 1600			& 0 		\\
1		& 800			& 108800	\\
2		& 400			& 119000	\\
3		& 200			& 122800	\\
4		& 50			& 140400	\\
5		& 6.25			& 141160 *	\\
After BH	& 6.25			& 141335 **	\\
\end{tabular}
\\
\\
** This level is not used in the movie we created, since level 4 completely covers the time during level 5. We provide this data just in case it is needed for higher time resolution. \\
*** Note that the iteration number of the first frame in after bh folder in this case is not zero, but at it=7168. The time at which it=0 for this level corresponds to t=141160.
