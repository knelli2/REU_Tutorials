# REU_Tutorials
This is a repository which will have all the updated tutorials for future REU groups

Things we probably need to update:
	-get rid of most of the coding stuff like awk and sed. It's pretty useless. Keep some commands though that will possibly be useful in the terminal
	-get rid of the section on making VTK files because we never do that
	-Kyle will update ALL of the gravity wave sections immensly
	-Minh and Guangkuo will add a section on Omega plots
	-possibly a good idea to add complete section on how to use abid_bot
	-Once we finish, add section on g00
	-Add git section because that is new
	-Possibly particle picker? We'd need to go through that
